<h1> Create a DocType XML </hi>


<h2> Prerequisites </h2>

<ul>
<li> A super user (host) account. Super user privileges are required to upload skins, because skins can include executables. The super user also converts the skin from HTML to ASCX. (An administrator account is sufficient to apply skins and containers to a site.)</li>
</ul>


<h2> Overview </h2>
If a page is not rendering properly in some browsers, you can force the skin to be rendered in <b>XHTML 1.0 Transitional</b> by creating a doctype XML file.

<h2> Steps </h2>
<ol type=a>

<li>Create a doctype XML file with the same name as your layout template file, followed by <b>.doctype.xml</b>.<br>
    <b>Example:</b> If your layout template file is called <b>MyLayout.html</b>, give your doctype file the name <b>MyLayout.doctype.xml</b>.
</li>

<li>Enter the following in your doctype file:
   <xmp>
   <SkinDocType>
      <![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">]]>
   </SkinDocType>
   </xmp>
</li>

</ol>
