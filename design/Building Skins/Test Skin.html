<h1> Test the Skin on a Web Page </hi>


<h2> Prerequisites </h2>

<ul>
<li> A super user (host) account. Super user privileges are required to upload skins, because skins can include executables. The super user also converts the skin from HTML to ASCX. (An administrator account is sufficient to apply skins and containers to a site.)</li>
</ul>


<h2> Steps </h2>
<ol>

<li>Create a new web page.</li>

<li>Edit the page settings and go to <b>Advanced Settings</b>.</li>

<li>In the <b>Page Skin</b> section, select <b>Host</b> and choose one of the layout templates from your new skin.<br>
   <b>Note:</b> When a layout template is added to the page, the associated CSS file is automatically added.
</li>

<li>Click <b>Update</b>.</li>

<li>View your page in different browsers to verify that the new skin was applied correctly.

</ol>
